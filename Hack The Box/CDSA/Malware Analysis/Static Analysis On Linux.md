In the realm of malware analysis, we exercise a method called static analysis to scrutinize malware without necessitating its execution. This involves the meticulous investigation of malware's code, data, and structural components, serving as a vital precursor for further, more detailed analysis.

Through static analysis, we endeavor to extract pivotal information which includes:

- File type
- File hash
- Strings
- Embedded elements
- Packer information
- Imports
- Exports
- Assembly code

![Flowchart of malware analysis steps: Input malware sample, File type, Fingerprinting, Packer Detection, String Extraction, PE Header Information, Classification, Detection Rule.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/227/static_analysis_flow.png)

Let's now navigate to the bottom of this section and click on "Click here to spawn the target system!". Then, let's SSH into the Target IP using the provided credentials. The vast majority of the actions/commands covered from this point up to end of this section can be replicated inside the target, offering a more comprehensive grasp of the topics presented.

## Identifying The File Type

Our first port of call in this stage is to ascertain the rudimentary information about the malware specimen to lay the groundwork for our investigation. Given that file extensions can be manipulated and changed, our task is to devise a method to identify the actual file type we are encountering. Establishing the file type plays an integral role in static analysis, ensuring that the procedures we apply are appropriate and the results obtained are accurate.

Let's use a Windows-based malware named `Ransomware.wannacry.exe` residing in the `/home/htb-student/Samples/MalwareAnalysis` directory of this section's target as an illustration.

The command for checking the file type of this malware would be the following.

  Static Analysis On Linux

```shell-session
LeDaav@htb[/htb]$ file /home/htb-student/Samples/MalwareAnalysis/Ransomware.wannacry.exe
/home/htb-student/Samples/MalwareAnalysis/Ransomware.wannacry.exe: PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows
```

We can also do the same by manually checking the header with the help of the `hexdump` command as follows.

  Static Analysis On Linux

```shell-session
LeDaav@htb[/htb]$ hexdump -C /home/htb-student/Samples/MalwareAnalysis/Ransomware.wannacry.exe | more

On a Windows system, the presence of the ASCII string `MZ` (in hexadecimal: `4D 5A`) at the start of a file (known as the "magic number") denotes an executable file. `MZ` stands for Mark Zbikowski, a key architect of MS-DOS.

## Malware Fingerprinting

In this stage, our mission is to create a unique identifier for the malware sample. This typically takes the form of a cryptographic hash - MD5, SHA1, or SHA256.

Fingerprinting is employed for numerous purposes, encompassing:

- Identification and tracking of malware samples
- Scanning an entire system for the presence of identical malware
- Confirmation of previous encounters and analyses of the same malware
- Sharing with stakeholders as IoC (Indicators of Compromise) or as part of threat intelligence reports

As an illustration, to check the MD5 file hash of the abovementioned malware the command would be the following.

  Static Analysis On Linux

```shell-session
LeDaav@htb[/htb]$ md5sum /home/htb-student/Samples/MalwareAnalysis/Ransomware.wannacry.exe
db349b97c37d22f5ea1d1841e3c89eb4  /home/htb-student/Samples/MalwareAnalysis/Ransomware.wannacry.exe
```

To check the SHA256 file hash of the abovementioned malware the command would be the following.

  Static Analysis On Linux

```shell-session
LeDaav@htb[/htb]$ sha256sum /home/htb-student/Samples/MalwareAnalysis/Ransomware.wannacry.exe
24d004a104d4d54034dbcffc2a4b19a11f39008a575aa614ea04703480b1022c  /home/htb-student/Samples/MalwareAnalysis/Ransomware.wannacry.exe
```

## File Hash Lookup

The ensuing step involves checking the file hash produced in the prior step against online malware scanners and sandboxes such as Cuckoo sandbox. For instance, VirusTotal, an online malware scanning engine, which collaborates with various antivirus vendors, allows us to search for the file hash. This step aids us in comparing our results with existing knowledge about the malware sample.

The following image displays the results from [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/search) after the SHA256 file hash of the aforementioned malware was submitted.

![VirusTotal analysis showing 68 out of 71 security vendors flagging lhdfrgui.exe as malicious, with threat categories including trojan, ransomware, and worm. Popular threat label: trojan.wannacry/wanna.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/227/virustotal_scan.png)

Even though a file hash like MD5, SHA1, or SHA256 is valuable for identifying identical samples with disparate names, it falls short when identifying similar malware samples. This is primarily because a malware author can alter the file hash value by making minor modifications to the code and recompiling it.

Nonetheless, there exist techniques that can aid in identifying similar samples:

### Import Hashing (IMPHASH)

`IMPHASH`, an abbreviation for "Import Hash", is a cryptographic hash calculated from the import functions of a Windows Portable Executable (PE) file. Its algorithm functions by first converting all imported function names to lowercase. Following this, the DLL names and function names are fused together and arranged in alphabetical order. Finally, an MD5 hash is generated from the resulting string. Therefore, two PE files with identical import functions, in the same sequence, will share an `IMPHASH` value.

We can find the `IMPHASH` in the `Details` tab of the VirusTotal results.

![VirusTotal analysis showing a community score of 68/71, with basic properties including MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, and Imphash: 9ecee117164e0b870a53dd187cdd7174.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/227/imphash_vt1.png)

Note that we can also use the [pefile](https://pypi.org/project/pefile/) Python module to compute the IMPHASH of a file as follows.

Code: python

```python
import sys
import pefile
import peutils

pe_file = sys.argv[1]
pe = pefile.PE(pe_file)
imphash = pe.get_imphash()

print(imphash)
```

To check the IMPHASH of the abovementioned [WannaCry](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/wannacry-ransomware-attack) malware the command would be the following. `imphash_calc.py` (available at `/home/htb-student`) contains the Python code above.

  Static Analysis On Linux

```shell-session
LeDaav@htb[/htb]$ python3 imphash_calc.py /home/htb-student/Samples/MalwareAnalysis/Ransomware.wannacry.exe
9ecee117164e0b870a53dd187cdd7174
```

### Fuzzy Hashing (SSDEEP)

`Fuzzy Hashing (SSDEEP)`, also referred to as context-triggered piecewise hashing (CTPH), is a hashing technique designed to compute a hash value indicative of content similarity between two files. This technique dissects a file into smaller, fixed-size blocks and calculates a hash for each block. The resulting hash values are then consolidated to generate the final fuzzy hash.

The `SSDEEP` algorithm allocates more weight to longer sequences of common blocks, making it highly effective in identifying files that have undergone minor modifications, or are similar but not identical, such as different variations of a malicious sample.

We can find the `SSDEEP` hash of a malware in the `Details` tab of the VirusTotal results.

We can also use the `ssdeep` command to calculate the `SSDEEP` hash of a file. To check the `SSDEEP` hash of the abovementioned WannaCry malware the command would be the following.

  Static Analysis On Linux

```shell-session
LeDaav@htb[/htb]$ ssdeep /home/htb-student/Samples/MalwareAnalysis/Ransomware.wannacry.exe
ssdeep,1.1--blocksize:hash:hash,filename
98304:wDqPoBhz1aRxcSUDk36SAEdhvxWa9P593R8yAVp2g3R:wDqPe1Cxcxk3ZAEUadzR8yc4gB,"/home/htb-student/Samples/MalwareAnalysis/Ransomware.wannacry.exe"
```

![VirusTotal analysis showing 67/71 vendors flagging lhdfrgui.exe as malicious. SSDEEP hash: 98304:wDqPoBhz1aRxcSUDk36SAEdhvxWa9P593R8yAVp2g3R:wDqPe1Cxcxk3ZAEUadzR8yc4gB.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/227/ssdeep_vt1.png)

The command line arguments `-pb` can be used to initiate matching mode in `SSDEEP` (while we are on the directory where the malware samples are stored - `/home/htb-student/Samples/MalwareAnalysis` in our case).

  Static Analysis On Linux

```shell-session
LeDaav@htb[/htb]$ ssdeep -pb *
potato.exe matches svchost.exe (99)

svchost.exe matches potato.exe (99)
```

`-p` denotes Pretty matching mode, and `-b` is used to display only the file names, excluding full paths.

In the example above, a 99% similarity was observed between two malware samples (`svchost.exe` and `potato.exe`) using `SSDEEP`.

### Section Hashing (Hashing PE Sections)

`Section hashing`, (hashing PE sections) is a powerful technique that allows analysts to identify sections of a Portable Executable (PE) file that have been modified. This can be particularly useful for identifying minor variations in malware samples, a common tactic employed by attackers to evade detection.

The `Section Hashing` technique works by calculating the cryptographic hash of each of these sections. When comparing two PE files, if the hash of corresponding sections in the two files matches, it suggests that the particular section has not been modified between the two versions of the file.

By applying `section hashing`, security analysts can identify parts of a PE file that have been tampered with or altered. This can help identify similar malware samples, even if they have been slightly modified to evade traditional signature-based detection methods.

Tools such as `pefile` in Python can be used to perform `section hashing`. In Python, for example, you can use the pefile module to access and hash the data in individual sections of a PE file as follows.

Code: python

```python
import sys
import pefile
pe_file = sys.argv[1]
pe = pefile.PE(pe_file)
for section in pe.sections:
    print (section.Name, "MD5 hash:", section.get_hash_md5())
    print (section.Name, "SHA256 hash:", section.get_hash_sha256())
```

Remember that while `section hashing` is a powerful technique, it is not foolproof. Malware authors might employ tactics like section name obfuscation or dynamically generating section names to try and bypass this kind of analysis.

As an illustration, to check the MD5 and SHA256 PE section hashes of a Wannacry executable stored in the `/home/htb-student/Samples/MalwareAnalysis` directory, the command would be the following. `section_hashing.py` (available at `/home/htb-student`) contains the Python code above.

  Static Analysis On Linux

```shell-session
LeDaav@htb[/htb]$ python3 section_hashing.py /home/htb-student/Samples/MalwareAnalysis/Ransomware.wannacry.exe

```

## String Analysis

In this phase, our objective is to extract strings (ASCII & Unicode) from a binary. Strings can furnish clues and valuable insight into the functionality of the malware. Occasionally, we can unearth unique embedded strings in a malware sample, such as:

- Embedded filenames (e.g., dropped files)
- IP addresses or domain names
- Registry paths or keys
- Windows API functions
- Command-line arguments
- Unique information that might hint at a particular threat actor

The Linux `strings` command can be deployed to display the strings contained within a malware. For instance, the command below will reveal strings for a ransomware sample named `dharma_sample.exe` residing in the `/home/htb-student/Samples/MalwareAnalysis` directory of this section's target.

  Static Analysis On Linux

```shell-session
LeDaav@htb[/htb]$ strings -n 15 /home/htb-student/Samples/MalwareAnalysis/dharma_sample.exe
!This program cannot be run in DOS mode.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@>@@@?456789:;<=@@@@@@@
!"#$%&'()*+,-./0123@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/
WaitForSingleObject
InitializeCriticalSectionAndSpinCount
LeaveCriticalSection
EnterCriticalSection
C:\crysis\Release\PDB\payload.pdb
0123456789ABCDEF
```

`-n` specifies to print a sequence of at least the number specified - in our case, `15`.

Occasionally, string analysis can facilitate the linkage of a malware sample to a specific threat group if significant similarities are identified. For [example](https://thedfirreport.com/2020/06/16/the-little-ransomware-that-couldnt-dharma/), in the link provided, a string containing a PDB path was used to link the malware sample to the Dharma/Crysis family of ransomware.

![String showing file path: C:\crysis\Release\PDB\payload.pdb at offset 0xc814.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/227/dharma.png)

---

It should be noted that another string analysis solution exists called `FLOSS`. `FLOSS`, short for "FireEye Labs Obfuscated String Solver", is a tool developed by FireEye's FLARE team to automatically deobfuscate strings in malware. It's designed to supplement the use of traditional string tools, like the strings command in Unix-based systems, which can miss obfuscated strings that are commonly used by malware to evade detection.

For instance, the command below will reveal strings for a ransomware sample named `dharma_sample.exe` residing in the `/home/htb-student/Samples/MalwareAnalysis` directory of this section's target.

## Unpacking UPX-packed Malware

In our static analysis, we might stumble upon a malware sample that's been compressed or obfuscated using a technique referred to as packing. Packing serves several purposes:

- It obfuscates the code, making it more challenging to discern its structure or functionality.
- It reduces the size of the executable, making it quicker to transfer or less conspicuous.
- It confounds security researchers by hindering traditional reverse engineering attempts.

This can impair string analysis because the references to strings are typically obscured or eliminated. It also replaces or camouflages conventional PE sections with a compact loader stub, which retrieves the original code from a compressed data section. As a result, the malware file becomes both smaller and more difficult to analyze, as the original code isn't directly observable.

A popular packer used in many malware variants is the `Ultimate Packer for Executables (UPX)`.

Let's first see what happens when we run the `strings` command on a UPX-packed malware sample named `credential_stealer.exe` residing in the `/home/htb-student/Samples/MalwareAnalysis/packed` directory of this section's target.

  Static Analysis On Linux

Observe the strings that include `UPX`, and take note that the remainder of the output doesn't yield any valuable information regarding the functionality of the malware.

We can unpack the malware using the `UPX` tool with the following command (while we are on the directory where the packed malware samples are stored - `/home/htb-student/Samples/MalwareAnalysis/packed` in our case).
