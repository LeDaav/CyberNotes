Once we have that first set of AD credentials and the means to authenticate with them on the network, a whole new world of possibilities opens up! We can start enumerating various details about the AD setup and structure with authenticated access, even super low-privileged access.

During a red team engagement, this will usually lead to us being able to perform some form of privilege escalation or lateral movement to gain additional access until we have sufficient privileges to execute and reach our goals. In most cases, enumeration and exploitation are heavily entwined. Once an attack path shown by the enumeration phase has been exploited, enumeration is again performed from this new privileged position, as shown in the diagram below.

## Credentials injection

### Runas Explained

Have you ever found AD credentials but nowhere to log in with them? Runas may be the answer you've been looking for!

In security assessments, you will often have network access and have just discovered AD credentials but have no means or privileges to create a new domain-joined machine. So we need the ability to use those credentials on a Windows machine we control.

If we have the AD credentials in the format of <username>:<password>, we can use Runas, a legitimate Windows binary, to inject the credentials into memory. The usual Runas command would look something like this:

`` 
runas.exe /netonly /user:<domain>\<username> cmd.exe
``

Let's look at the parameters:

- **/netonly** - Since we are not domain-joined, we want to load the credentials for network authentication but not authenticate against a domain controller. So commands executed locally on the computer will run in the context of your standard Windows account, but any network connections will occur using the account specified here.
- **/user** - Here, we provide the details of the domain and the username. It is always a safe bet to use the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) instead of just the NetBIOS name of the domain since this will help with resolution.
- **cmd.exe** - This is the program we want to execute once the credentials are injected. This can be changed to anything, but the safest bet is cmd.exe since you can then use that to launch whatever you want, with the credentials injected.

Once you run this command, you will be prompted to supply a password. Note that since we added the /netonly parameter, the credentials will not be verified directly by a domain controller so that it will accept any password. We still need to confirm that the network credentials are loaded successfully and correctly.

**Note:** If you use your own Windows machine, you should make sure that you run your first Command Prompt as Administrator. This will inject an Administrator token into CMD. If you run tools that require local Administrative privileges from your Runas spawned CMD, the token will already be available. This does not give you administrative privileges on the network, but will ensure that any local commands you execute, will execute with administrative privileges.  

It's Always DNS

**Note:** These next steps you only need to perform if you use your own Windows machine for the exercise. However, it is good knowledge to learn how to perform since it may be helpful on red team exercises.

After providing the password, a new command prompt window will open. Now we still need to verify that our credentials are working. The most surefire way to do this is to list SYSVOL. Any AD account, no matter how low-privileged, can read the contents of the SYSVOL directory.

SYSVOL is a folder that exists on all domain controllers. It is a shared folder storing the Group Policy Objects (GPOs) and information along with any other domain related scripts. It is an essential component for Active Directory since it delivers these GPOs to all computers on the domain. Domain-joined computers can then read these GPOs and apply the applicable ones, making domain-wide configuration changes from a central location.

Before we can list SYSVOL, we need to configure our DNS. Sometimes you are lucky, and internal DNS will be configured for you automatically through DHCP or the VPN connection, but not always (like this TryHackMe network). It is good to understand how to do it manually. Your safest bet for a DNS server is usually a domain controller. Using the IP of the domain controller, we can execute the following commands in a PowerShell window:

```powershell
$dnsip = "<DC IP>"
$index = Get-NetAdapter -Name 'Ethernet' | Select-Object -ExpandProperty 'ifIndex'
Set-DnsClientServerAddress -InterfaceIndex $index -ServerAddresses $dnsip
```

Of course, 'Ethernet' will be whatever interface is connected to the TryHackMe network. We can verify that DNS is working by running the following:

Command Prompt

```shell-session
C:\> nslookup za.tryhackme.com
```

Which should now resolve to the DC IP since this is where the FQDN is being hosted. Now that DNS is working, we can finally test our credentials. We can use the following command to force a network-based listing of the SYSVOL directory:

Command Prompt

```shell-session
C:\Tools>dir \\za.tryhackme.com\SYSVOL\
 Volume in drive \\za.tryhackme.com\SYSVOL is Windows
 Volume Serial Number is 1634-22A9

 Directory of \\za.tryhackme.com\SYSVOL

02/24/2022  09:57 PM    <DIR>          .
02/24/2022  09:57 PM    <DIR>          ..
02/24/2022  09:57 PM    <JUNCTION>     za.tryhackme.com [C:\Windows\SYSVOL\domain]
               0 File(s)              0 bytes
               3 Dir(s)  51,835,408,384 bytes free
```

We won't go too much in-depth now into the contents of SYSVOL, but note that it is also good to enumerate its contents since there may be some additional AD credentials lurking there.  

IP vs Hostnames

**Question:** _Is there a difference between_ _`dir \\za.tryhackme.com\SYSVOL` and `dir \\<DC IP>\SYSVOL`_ _and why the big fuss about DNS?_

There is quite a difference, and it boils down to the authentication method being used. When we provide the hostname, network authentication will attempt first to perform Kerberos authentication. Since Kerberos authentication uses hostnames embedded in the tickets, if we provide the IP instead, we can force the authentication type to be NTLM. While on the surface, this does not matter to us right now, it is good to understand these slight differences since they can allow you to remain more stealthy during a Red team assessment. In some instances, organisations will be monitoring for OverPass- and Pass-The-Hash Attacks. Forcing NTLM authentication is a good trick to have in the book to avoid detection in these cases.

Using Injected Credentials

Now that we have injected our AD credentials into memory, this is where the fun begins. With the /netonly option, all network communication will use these injected credentials for authentication. This includes all network communications of applications executed from that command prompt window.

This is where it becomes potent. Have you ever had a case where an MS SQL database used Windows Authentication, and you were not domain-joined? Start MS SQL Studio from that command prompt; even though it shows your local username, click Log In, and it will use the AD credentials in the background to authenticate! We can even use this to [authenticate to web applications that use NTLM Authentication](https://labs.f-secure.com/blog/pth-attacks-against-ntlm-authenticated-web-applications/).  

We will be using that in the next task for our first AD enumeration technique.

You should have completed the [AD Basics room](https://tryhackme.com/jr/activedirectorybasics) by now, where different AD objects were initially introduced. In this task, it will be assumed that you understand what these objects are. Connect to THMJMP1 using RDP and your provisioned credentials from Task 1 to perform this task.  

Microsoft Management Console  

In this task, we will explore our first enumeration method, which is the only method that makes use of a GUI until the very last task. We will be using the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) with the [Remote Server Administration Tools'](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/activedirectory/?view=windowsserver2022-ps) (RSAT) AD Snap-Ins. If you use the provided Windows VM (THMJMP1), it has already been installed for you. However, if you are using your own Windows machine, you can perform the following steps to install the Snap-Ins:

1. Press **Start**
2. Search **"Apps & Features"** and press enter
3. Click **Manage Optional Features**
4. Click **Add a feature**
5. Search for **"RSAT"**
6. Select "**RSAT: Active Directory Domain Services and Lightweight Directory Tools"** and click **Install**

You can start MMC by using the Windows Start button, searching run, and typing in MMC. If we just run MMC normally, it would not work as our computer is not domain-joined, and our local account cannot be used to authenticate to the domain.

![MMC failed start due to credentials](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6093e17fa004d20049b6933e/room-content/dd93acc5bf807d120eb083d2250e77ef.png)  

This is where the Runas window from the previous task comes into play. In that window, we can start MMC, which will ensure that all MMC network connections will use our injected AD credentials.  

In MMC, we can now attach the AD RSAT Snap-In:

1. Click **File** -> **Add/Remove Snap-in**
2. Select and **Add** all three Active Directory Snap-ins
3. Click through any errors and warnings  
    
4. Right-click on **Active Directory Domains and Trusts** and select **Change Forest**
5. Enter _za.tryhackme.com_ as the **Root domain** and Click **OK**
6. Right-click on **Active Directory Sites and Services** and select **Change Forest**
7. Enter _za.tryhackme.com_ as the **Root domain** and Click OK
8. Right-click on **Active Directory Users and Computers** and select **Change Domain**
9. Enter _za.tryhackme.com_ as the **Domain** and Click **OK**
10. Right-click on **Active Directory Users and Computers** in the left-hand pane  
    
11. Click on **View** -> **Advanced Features**  
    

If everything up to this point worked correctly, your MMC should now be pointed to, and authenticated against, the target Domain:

![MMC AD Snap-in](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6093e17fa004d20049b6933e/room-content/da8bba5a4df58baf0045d4a71db37e05.png)

We can now start enumerating information about the AD structure here.

Users and Computers

Let's take a look at the Active Directory structure. For this task, we will focus on AD Users and Computers. Expand that snap-in and expand the za domain to see the initial Organisational Unit (OU) structure:

![MMC AD Snap-in](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6093e17fa004d20049b6933e/room-content/a5fc9efbd6a77ee9ea72a25d7ba13240.png)

Let's take a look at the People directory. Here we see that the users are divided according to department OUs. Clicking on each of these OUs will show the users that belong to that department.

![MMC AD Snap-in](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6093e17fa004d20049b6933e/room-content/993c161b6d86d61bf5ecc31a0ce0fa54.png)

Clicking on any of these users will allow us to review all of their properties and attributes. We can also see what groups they are a member of:

![MMC AD Snap-in](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6093e17fa004d20049b6933e/room-content/659127fd61749667192a19e0fb71ad55.png)

We can also use MMC to find hosts in the environment. If we click on either Servers or Workstations, the list of domain-joined machines will be displayed.

![MMC AD Snap-in](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6093e17fa004d20049b6933e/room-content/9e353f21616effb4a9cca2f3e86e65ad.png)

If we had the relevant permissions, we could also use MMC to directly make changes to AD, such as changing the user's password or adding an account to a specific group. Play around with MMC to better understand the AD domain structure. Make use of the search feature to look for objects.
