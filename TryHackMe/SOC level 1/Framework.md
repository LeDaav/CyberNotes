# Pyramid of Pain

### Breakdown of the Pyramid of Pain

1. **Hashes** (bottom): Easy to change, minimal pain for attackers.
2. **IP Addresses**: Slightly harder to change, but still relatively easy for attackers.
3. **Domain Names**: More difficult to change than IP addresses, moderate pain.
4. **Network/Host Artifacts**: Harder to modify, significant pain for attackers.
5. **Tools**: Adapting tools is challenging and resource-intensive, causing more pain.
6. **Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)** (top): Changing core strategies is very difficult and causes maximum pain for attackers.
